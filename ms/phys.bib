  abstract = "Dimorphic fungi cause several endemic mycoses which range from
              subclinical respiratory infections to life-threatening systemic
              disease. Pathogenic-phase cells of Histoplasma, Blastomyces,
              Paracoccidioides and Coccidioides escape elimination by the
              innate immune response with control ultimately requiring
              activation of cell-mediated immunity. Clinical management of
              disease relies primarily on antifungal compounds; however,
              dimorphic fungal pathogens create a number of challenges for
              antifungal drug therapy. In addition to the drug toxicity issues
              known for current antifungals, barriers to efficient drug
              treatment of dimorphic fungal infections include natural
              resistance to the echinocandins, residence of fungal cells within
              immune cells, the requirement for systemic delivery of drugs,
              prolonged treatment times, potential for latent infections, and
              lack of optimized standardized methodology for in vitro testing
              of drug susceptibilities. This review will highlight recent
              advances, current therapeutic options, and new compounds on the

  abstract = "The signature feature of systemic dimorphic fungi - a family of
              six primary fungal pathogens of humans - is a temperature-induced
              phase transition. These fungi grow as a mold in soil at ambient
              temperature and convert to yeast after infectious spores are
              inhaled into the lungs of a mammalian host. Seminal work 20 years
              ago established that a temperature-induced phase transition from
              mold to yeast is required for virulence. Several yeast-phase
              specific genes, identified one-by-one and studied by reverse
              genetics, have revealed mechanisms by which the phase transition
              promotes disease pathogenesis. Transcriptional profiling of
              microarrays built with genomic elements of Histoplasma capsulatum
              and ESTs of Paracoccidioides brasiliensis that represent partial
              genomes has identified 500 genes and 328 genes, respectively,
              that are differentially expressed upon the phase transition. The
              genomes of most of the dimorphic fungi are now in varying stages
              of being sequenced. The creation of additional microarrays and
              the application of new reverse genetic tools promise fresh
              insight into genes and mechanisms that regulate pathogenesis and
              morphogenesis. The use of insertional mutagenesis by
              Agrobacterium has uncovered a hybrid histidine kinase that
              regulates dimorphism and pathogenicity in Blastomyces
              dermatitidis and H. capsulatum. Two-component signaling appears

              state and the pellets never revert back to filamentous form.
              Apart from the normal cycle, high temperature (37Â°C and above)
              and extreme pH also induced the yeast formation. Among the ions
              tested, calcium and chloride ions were found to restore the
              filamentous morphology, even in extreme pH and temperature.
              Cysteine HCl also played noteworthy role in maintaining mycelial
              growth even at adverse condition. Immobilized spores showed the
              appearance of intermediate form instead of typical yeast form

              output such as activation of transcription, or of a
              mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade. The genomes of the
              yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, and

              The triggering event is a heat-related insult induced by the
              temperature shift which results in partial uncoupling of
              oxidative phosphorylation and declines in cellular ATP levels,

              shift into a recovery phase during which transformation to yeast
              morphology occurs (stage 3). Cysteine is required during stage 2
              for the operation of shunt pathways which permit electron

              with a frequency function, which is proportional to the total
              hyphal length. The model is used to simulate a population of
              mycelia, where spore germination is described with a log-normal
              distribution. From the simulation of the population, the average
              properties of the mycelia, e.g., the average total hyphal length,
              are calculated, and by fitting the model to experimental data the
              model parameters are estimated. Finally, the distribution
              function with respect to the mycelia properties, that is, number
              of tips and total hyphal length, is calculated, and it
              corresponds well with the experimental determination of the
              distribution function. (c) 1995 John Wiley \& Sons Inc.",

  abstract = "Pseudohyphal growth of Candida albicans has been recognized as a
              morphological growth form that exhibits characteristics that are
              distinct from those of the budding yeast phase and true hyphal
              form of this pathogenic fungus. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
              pseudohypha growth involves synchronous unipolar cell divisions
              that are a modification of the bipolar budding pattern of diploid
              cells. While pseudohyphae of C. albicans also exhibit unipolar
              cell divisions, live cell imaging demonstrated departures from
              the normal unipolar pattern. Buds occasionally followed a bipolar
              or axial budding event in which buds could be formed from the
              proximal or distal ends of a parent pseudohypha. This extends the
              known morphological repertoire of cell division patterns in C.

  title     = "Investigations on the Theory of the Brownian Movement",
  author    = "Einstein, Albert",
  abstract  = "The ``Brownian movement'' was first described in 1828 by the
               botanist Robert Brown. While investigating the pollen of several
               different plants, he observed that pollen dispersed in water in
               a great number of small particles which he perceived to be in
               uninterrupted and irregular ``swarming'' motion. For more than
               half a century following, a score of scientists studied this
               motion, common to organic and inorganic particles of microscopic
               size when suspended in a liquid, to determine the causes and the
               dynamics of the motion. This volume contains five papers
               investigating the dynamics of this phenomenon by Albert
               Einstein. Written between 1905 and 1908, the papers evolve an
               elementary theory of the Brownian motion, of interest not only
               to mathematicians but also to chemists and physical chemists.
               The titles of the papers are: ``Movement of Small Particles
               Suspended in a Stationary Liquid Demanded by the
               Molecular-Kinetic Theory of Heat''; ``On the Theory of the
               Brownian Movement''; ``A New Determination of Molecular
               Dimensions''; ``Theoretical Observations on the Brownian
               Motion''; and ``Elementary Theory of the Brownian Motion.'' The
               editor, R. F{\"u}rth, has provided notes at the end of the book
               which discuss the history of the investigation of the Brownian
               movement, provide simple elucidations of the text, and analyze
               the significance of these papers.",
